# Predict_car_price_KNN
This is a guided project from Dataquest with several additional analysis conducted by myself. We will build up the machine learning workflow (k-nearest neighbors algorithm) to predict a car's market price.

1. Data cleaning and explore the correlation between the features we input to train the model and the price.
2. Build up a simple univariate model
3. Build up a simple multivariate model
4. Optimizing the model - test different combination of input features with different k-neighbor values.
